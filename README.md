# integer-tree

##### NeuroScouting Dev Technical Problem #1

### Overview
At the very start, the `validate` function takes in the command-line arguments and makes two checks. The first one ensures that a tree depth is provided, and the second one makes sure it is a valid value. Once validation is complete, `initialize_tree` creates an empty tree (comprised of `Node`s) of our desired depth by recursively traversing it in pre-order and making filler nodes, filled with ones. After we have the tree structure, `populate_tree` traverses it in level-order and calculates all of the node values. Finally, `display_tree` reads the data in the tree and formats it nicely to then print it.
